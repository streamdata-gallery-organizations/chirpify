description: 'We work with brands and agencies who want to leverage social as the
  point of conversion for their multi-channel marketing campaigns. Clients like adidas,
  Mastercard &amp; RCA Records use our Social Conversion Platform to activate their
  advertising - enabling consumers to #vote, #donate and #buy directly through social
  channels. Since launching in February of 2012, we&rsquo;ve had hundreds of brands
  and merchants launch more than 10,000 campaigns on our platform. And we&rsquo;ve
  attracted a great group of investors that includes Voyager Capital, the former CEO
  of McCann Worldgroup, and the CEO of Hootsuite.'
